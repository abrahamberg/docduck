Neural networks are computational models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected layers of nodes (neurons) that transform inputs through weighted connections and activation functions to produce outputs. Simple networks include feedforward multilayer perceptrons; more complex forms include convolutional networks for spatial data and recurrent networks for sequential data.

Networks learn by adjusting weights to minimize a loss function using optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent and its variants. Backpropagation computes gradients efficiently through the chain rule and enables end-to-end training.

Architectural choices (number of layers, layer sizes, activation functions) and training techniques (learning rate schedules, regularization) strongly influence model capabilities. Neural networks excel at function approximation and pattern recognition, enabling tasks such as image classification, speech synthesis, and time-series prediction.

While powerful, neural networks also raise issues: they can require large datasets, may be sensitive to hyperparameters, and can be opaque in their inner workings. Research in interpretability, pruning, quantization, and neural architecture search aims to make networks more efficient, understandable, and adaptable to a wide range of applications.
