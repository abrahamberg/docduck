Deep learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with many layers (deep architectures). These models automatically learn hierarchical feature representations from raw data, enabling breakthroughs in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Popular architectures include convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for images, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequences, and transformer models for language.

Training deep networks typically requires large datasets, substantial compute resources, and careful techniques such as regularization, dropout, batch normalization, and advanced optimization methods (Adam, RMSprop). Transfer learning allows pre-trained deep models to be fine-tuned on downstream tasks, reducing data requirements and speeding development.

Deep learning models have enabled state-of-the-art performance in tasks like object detection, machine translation, and generative modeling. However, they pose challenges: difficulty explaining decisions, vulnerability to adversarial inputs, significant energy and compute costs, and potential for learning biases present in training data.

Ongoing research focuses on model efficiency (smaller and faster models), interpretability, robust training methods, and new architectures that balance performance with resource constraints. Deep learning integrates with broader AI systems to provide perception and reasoning capabilities in real-world applications.
