Machine learning (ML) is a field of computer science that develops algorithms enabling systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming for each specific task. ML techniques include supervised learning (learning from labeled examples), unsupervised learning (discovering structure in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning via rewards and penalties in an environment).

Supervised learning tasks include classification and regression; algorithms like decision trees, support vector machines, and ensemble methods (random forests, gradient boosting) are common. Unsupervised learning covers clustering and dimensionality reduction (k-means, hierarchical clustering, PCA). Reinforcement learning uses agents that interact with environments to maximize cumulative reward, with applications in control, robotics, and game playing.

ML performance depends on data quality, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and robust evaluation practices. Overfitting, where models learn noise rather than general patterns, and bias in data are ongoing challenges. The field overlaps with statistics, optimization, and domain-specific engineering.

Recent advances in compute power and data availability have driven growth in deep learning models, making ML central to applications like image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous systems. Responsible ML also addresses interpretability, fairness, and privacy concerns.
