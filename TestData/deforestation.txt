Deforestation is the clearing or removal of forests to make way for agricultural expansion, logging, infrastructure, and urban development. It is a major driver of biodiversity loss, soil degradation, and greenhouse gas emissions. When forests are removed, the carbon stored in trees and soils may be released to the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. Tropical deforestation, in particular, has significant global impacts because tropical forests store large amounts of biodiversity and carbon.

Causes of deforestation vary by region. Agricultural commodity production (soy, palm oil, cattle ranching) is a leading cause in many tropical countries, while logging (legal and illegal), fuelwood collection, and infrastructure projects also contribute. Socioeconomic drivers — land tenure systems, economic incentives, poverty, and policy failures — influence local decisions.

Efforts to curb deforestation include protected areas, sustainable forest management certifications, payments for ecosystem services, and supply chain commitments by companies to reduce deforestation-linked commodities. Reforestation and afforestation programs aim to restore tree cover, and agroforestry integrates trees into farming systems to provide multiple benefits.

Effective solutions require addressing underlying drivers, strengthening governance and land rights, supporting sustainable livelihoods, and coordinating international trade and conservation policies. Monitoring via remote sensing and improved data is critical to track forest change and verify progress toward goals.
