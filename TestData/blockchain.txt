A blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that records transactions across a network of computers in a way that is intended to be tamper-evident and transparent. Blocks contain batches of transactions, a timestamp, and cryptographic links to previous blocks, forming a chain. Decentralized consensus mechanisms (proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, and others) allow network participants to agree on the ledger state without a central authority.

Blockchains enable digital asset transfers, smart contracts (programmable agreements), and decentralized applications. They raise trade-offs between scalability, decentralization, and security. Design choices influence throughput, latency, and energy consumption.

Applications include cryptocurrencies, supply chain provenance, digital identity systems, and decentralized finance. Challenges include regulatory uncertainty, privacy, interoperability, and environmental concerns linked to energy usage. Ongoing research addresses scalability (layer-2 solutions, sharding), governance, and privacy-preserving techniques.
