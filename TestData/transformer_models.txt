Transformer models are a class of neural network architectures introduced for sequence modeling and transduction tasks, characterized by attention mechanisms that enable models to weigh the importance of different input tokens. Unlike recurrent models, transformers process entire sequences in parallel, which facilitates scaling to large datasets and long-range dependencies.

Key innovations include self-attention, positional encodings to impart order information, and multi-head attention that allows the model to capture different types of relationships simultaneously. Transformers underpin many modern NLP advances, enabling large-scale pretraining on massive corpora followed by fine-tuning on downstream tasks.

Transformers are also adapted for vision (Vision Transformers), multimodal learning (combining text and images), and generative tasks. Large language models such as GPT variants, BERT, and other transformer-based families have achieved state-of-the-art results in numerous benchmarks.

Practical considerations include high computational cost for training and inference, memory demands for long sequences, and the need to mitigate biases learned from training data. Research continues on efficient transformer variants, sparse attention, and methods for better grounding and instruction-following.
