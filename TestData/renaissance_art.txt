Renaissance art refers to artistic production during the European Renaissance, roughly the 14th to 17th centuries, characterized by renewed interest in classical antiquity, humanism, and naturalistic representation. Artists explored perspective, anatomy, and proportion to create lifelike figures and coherent spatial compositions.

Masterpieces by artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Titian advanced techniques in painting, sculpture, and architecture. Themes ranged from religious narratives to portraiture, classical mythology, and studies of nature. The period also witnessed the rise of patronage systems, including commissions from courts, the Church, and wealthy merchants.

Renaissance art influenced social and intellectual currents, reflecting broader shifts in science, exploration, and philosophy. Study of technique, materials, and iconography continues to reveal cultural and historical contexts of artworks.
