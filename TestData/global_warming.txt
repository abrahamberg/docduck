Global warming describes the observed increase in Earth’s average surface temperature over recent decades. It is a central aspect of climate change and primarily driven by elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases accumulate in the atmosphere from human activities — fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, certain agricultural practices, and industrial processes — enhancing the greenhouse effect that naturally keeps Earth warm.

The measurable effects of global warming include higher global mean temperatures, earlier spring melting of snow and ice, shrinking glaciers, and increased frequency of extreme temperature events. Sea levels rise as polar ice melts and water expands when warmed, posing coastal risks. Ecosystems are shifting as species migrate toward poles or higher elevations, while coral reefs suffer from bleaching due to warming and acidifying oceans.

Addressing global warming involves both mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation actions aim to reduce or offset emissions via renewable energy, electrification of transportation, improved land use, carbon capture, and sustainable agriculture. Adaptation involves building resilient infrastructure, protecting water supplies, and developing heat-resilient crops. Policy instruments include carbon pricing, emissions trading, regulatory standards, and international agreements. The topic is a nexus of science, technology, economics, and geopolitics.
