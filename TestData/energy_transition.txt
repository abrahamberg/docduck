The energy transition describes the global shift from fossil-fuel-dominated energy systems toward low-carbon and renewable sources. Drivers include climate policy goals, technological advances in solar and wind, energy storage improvements, and changing economics. Electrification of transport and heating, grid modernization, and demand flexibility are key components.

Transition paths vary by region depending on resources, infrastructure, and policy. Challenges include integrating variable renewables, securing critical materials for energy technologies, ensuring energy access and affordability, and managing social impacts on workers in fossil fuel sectors. Policy tools — carbon pricing, subsidies for clean technologies, and regulatory reforms — help steer investment and deployment.

A successful transition aims to simultaneously reduce emissions, maintain reliable energy supplies, and support equitable economic outcomes. Coordinated action across governments, industry, and civil society accelerates progress toward climate targets.
