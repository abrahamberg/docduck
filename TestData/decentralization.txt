Decentralization refers to the distribution of authority, decision-making, or system operation away from a central point. In technology, decentralization is often associated with peer-to-peer systems, distributed ledgers, and architectures that reduce reliance on single points of control or failure. The concept also applies to governance, organizations, and political theory.

Benefits of decentralization include resilience, censorship resistance, and empowerment of participants. Trade-offs include coordination challenges, potential inefficiencies, and governance complexity. Implementations range from decentralized networks and distributed computing to cooperative organizations and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

Understanding decentralization involves technical design, social incentives, economic models, and regulatory context. Hybrid approaches sometimes combine centralized and decentralized components to balance performance and control.
