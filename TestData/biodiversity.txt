Biodiversity describes the variety of life on Earth across genes, species, and ecosystems. It underpins ecosystem services that humans rely on — food, clean water, pollination, disease regulation, and cultural and recreational value. High biodiversity often contributes to ecosystem resilience, enabling systems to better withstand disturbances such as pests, diseases, and climatic shifts.

Threats to biodiversity include habitat loss and fragmentation, overexploitation of species, pollution, invasive species, and climate change. Agricultural expansion, urban development, logging, and infrastructure degrade habitats and reduce species populations. Climate change alters habitats and species distributions, compounding these pressures.

Conservation strategies aim to protect habitats (protected areas, restoration ecology), regulate harvesting through sustainable management, control invasive species, and implement policies that incorporate biodiversity values into planning and development. International frameworks like the Convention on Biological Diversity set goals and coordinate conservation efforts globally.

Biodiversity conservation is linked to human well-being and sustainable development. Preserving ecosystem integrity supports food security, climate mitigation (through carbon stored in forests and soils), and cultural heritage. Interdisciplinary approaches combining ecology, socioeconomics, and governance are essential to meet conservation objectives while balancing human needs.
