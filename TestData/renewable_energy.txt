Renewable energy derives from naturally replenished sources such as sunlight, wind, water, geothermal heat, and biomass. Unlike fossil fuels, renewables produce low or zero direct greenhouse gas emissions during operation, making them central to decarbonization strategies aimed at mitigating climate change. Solar photovoltaic and wind power have seen dramatic cost reductions and rapid deployment over recent years, enabling widespread adoption for utility-scale and distributed generation.

Hydropower and geothermal have long provided baseload and dispatchable renewable electricity in many regions. Emerging technologies include tidal and wave energy, advanced geothermal, and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. Integration of variable renewables requires improvements in grid flexibility: energy storage (batteries, pumped hydro), demand response, transmission expansion, and smart grid technologies.

Renewables also intersect with economic and social dimensions. Deployment affects land use, community acceptance, supply chains for critical minerals, and employment patterns. Policies such as feed-in tariffs, auctions, renewable portfolio standards, and subsidies have shaped deployment. A just transition emphasizes fair outcomes for workers and communities when shifting away from fossil-fuel-dependent industries.

Scaling renewables while maintaining grid reliability and minimizing environmental impacts is a key engineering and policy challenge. Advancements in storage, grid controls, and efficient electrification are crucial to realizing the environmental benefits of renewable energy.
