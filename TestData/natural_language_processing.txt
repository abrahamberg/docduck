Natural language processing (NLP) is the study and engineering of computer systems that understand, generate, and manipulate human language. It draws on linguistics, machine learning, and computer science. Early NLP relied on rule-based systems and symbolic approaches; modern NLP predominantly uses statistical and machine learning methods, particularly deep learning.

NLP tasks include tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, syntactic parsing, sentiment analysis, machine translation, question answering, and summarization. Transformer-based models have driven recent progress, enabling large pre-trained language models that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.

Challenges in NLP include handling ambiguity, idiom, cultural context, and languages with limited resources. Ethical considerations involve biased outputs, misuse for disinformation, and privacy when models are trained on sensitive data. Tools like evaluation benchmarks, fairness metrics, and model card documentation help practitioners assess and communicate model behavior.

Applied NLP powers chatbots, search engines, content moderation, accessibility tools, and knowledge extraction systems. Ongoing research explores more efficient models, few-shot learning, grounding of language in perception, and interpretability of language systems.
